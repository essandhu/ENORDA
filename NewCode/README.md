# ENORDA

This is the folder that hosts up to date code for the raytheon drone project.

## Overview

There are a couple of utility classes and functions i'll like to bring to your attention

The GetEnemy class in GetEnemyPixCoords.py makes use of opencv to calculate distances between
the drone and the enemy using the aruco markers as a reference

The dummy general functions file defines dummy functions that can be used to test the execution
flow of your algoritms. 

the GeneralDroneFunctions file define operations that can be performed on the actual drone
